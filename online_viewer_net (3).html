        <p class="caption">Hubble image of a nebula, a vast cloud of gas and dust in space where stars are born.</p>
        <p>
          A nebula is a huge cloud of gas and dust situated in outer space. Some of these are star nurseries where star formation begins while others are the outer layers of red giants recently expelled. (Planetary Nebula)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Nebulae are essential for star formation and also recycle stellar material, seeding the galaxy with life-essential elements.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('brown-dwarf')">
      <h2>Brown Dwarf</h2>
      <div class="description" id="brown-dwarf">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Artist%E2%80%99s_conception_of_a_brown_dwarf_like_2MASSJ22282889-431026.jpg/1024px-Artist%E2%80%99s_conception_of_a_brown_dwarf_like_2MASSJ22282889-431026.jpg" alt="Brown Dwarf" />
        <p class="caption">Artist's conception of a brown dwarf star, larger than a planet but smaller than a true star.</p>
        <p>
          Brown dwarfs are objects more massive than planets but not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion like true stars. They form from collapsing gas clouds but never ignite fully as stars.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Brown dwarfs bridge the gap between planets and stars. They help astronomers understand the diversity of celestial bodies since these objects arent in either category of a planet or star.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('protostar')">
      <h2>Protostar</h2>
      <div class="description" id="protostar">
        <img src="https://cdn.esawebb.org/archives/images/screen/weic2219a.jpg" alt="Protostar" />
        <p class="caption">A protostar glowing in infrared as a gas cloud collapses under gravity to eventually form a star.</p>
        <p>
          A protostar forms from a clump of gas collapsing in a nebula. It is not yet a star, but it is heating up and glowing in the infrared.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This is the transition from a gas cloud to a nuclear-fusing star the birth of a star.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('t-tauri')">
      <h2>T Tauri Star</h2>
      <div class="description" id="t-tauri">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/TTauriStarDrawing.jpg" alt="T Tauri Star" />
        <p class="caption">Drawing of a young, variable T Tauri star surrounded by dust and strong stellar winds.</p>
        <p>
          A T Tauri star is a very young, variable star that forms just after the protostar stage. It is rapidly contracting and shedding material in strong stellar winds.They only form in regions of active star formation, such as stellar nurseries within molecular clouds.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> T Tauri stars mark a critical transition phase and help us study how solar systems form around young stars and in hard conditions especially.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('main-sequence')">
      <h2>Main Sequence Star</h2>

        <p class="caption">A stable main sequence star like our Sun, steadily fusing hydrogen into helium.</p>
        <p>
          A stable star that fuses hydrogen into helium through a process known as nuclear fusion which balance the star out and keeps it in its most stable condition in its entire life cycle. Our Sun is a example ofa yellow main sequence star.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> These stars are the most stable and long-lasting phase, able to support life and defining galaxies.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('red-giant')">
      <h2>Red Giant</h2>
      <div class="description" id="red-giant">

        <p class="caption">An expanding red giant star, larger and cooler than the Sun, nearing the end of its life.</p>
        <p>
          Formed when a low/medium-mass star runs out of hydrogen and starts burning helium, expanding enormously through the subgiant phase contracting before expanding 100x-1000x the original size.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> They enrich space with heavier elements needed for new stars and planets.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('planetary-nebula')">
  <h2>Planetary Nebula</h2>
  <div class="description" id="planetary-nebula">
    <img src="https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/screen/heic0910h.jpg" alt="Planetary Nebula">
    <p>A planetary nebula is the glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from red giants in the late stages of their evolution. The name is misleading as they have nothing to do with planets. These nebulae are observable in visible and infrared light.</p>
    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Planetary nebulae are crucial for spreading heavier elements like carbon and nitrogen into the interstellar medium. These enriched materials are essential for forming future stars, planets, and potentially life itself.</p>

        <p class="caption">A white dwarf, the hot, dense core left behind after a star sheds its outer layers.</p>
        <p>
          After shedding outer layers, a starâ€™s hot core becomes a white dwarf, slowly cooling over billions of years. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> These are stellar corpses that show us how sun-like stars end their lives since around 97% of our suns will eventually turn to white dwarfs..</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="stage" onclick="toggleDescription('black-dwarf')">

        <p class="caption">Theoretical black dwarf star, a cooled white dwarf no longer emitting significant heat or light.</p>
        <p>
          A theoretical remnant of a white dwarf that has cooled so much it no longer emits heat or light.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> None exist yet, but they represent the quiet, ultimate fate of sun-like stars.</p>

        <p class="caption">A massive red supergiant star, enormously expanded and unstable before going supernova.</p>
        <p>
          Massive stars expand into red supergiants which can get up to 500x the original size of the main sequence star before exploding. They're huge, unstable, and shed mass rapidly.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> They set the stage for the most powerful event which is a supernova.</p>
      </div>

        <p>
          A powerful explosion marking the death of a massive star. It can outshine an entire galaxy for a short time.
        </p>
